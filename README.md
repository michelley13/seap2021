# Programming Project for SEAP and turboPy 2021

## Project Details

This Python coded project was designed to allow users to label files and then combine them. The code will ask the user to input 3 different file names and label them accordingly. The code will then create a new file that combines all 3 of the inputed files into one. 


## Personal prerequisites (software/computer)
I used a ASUS Tuf Gaming A15 laptop to run all my code. My laptop is updated to the most recent Windows 10. My code was run using Python 3.


## Step-by-step Protocol Describing How to Use the Script
- step 1: Download data files from online databases. The files can be any type of text file and the user can use any database like the Proteome Exchange for protein specific data, but other data bases can be used for other types of data.
- step 2: The script can be downloaded from Github (michelley13/seap2021/MainScript) and opened in any application that supports Python code. (I personally used VScode) 
- step 3: Add the files that you want to use to the folder that is open in VScode.
- step 4: Run the code and input the full name (including .dox/.mgf in the name)

## The full script can be found under [MainScript.py](https://github.com/michelley13/seap2021/blob/e066ceaa943ea632edb40ab0b6f1b20c9917df79/MainScript.py)
